This GATE plugin provides a linguistically based document simplifier. This is
based upon work carried out in the ForgetIT project and reported in deliverables
D6.1 and D6.2.

The plugin contains a demo application (available from the Ready-Made menu if
the plugin has been loaded), which allows the techniques to be demonstrated.
The performance of the approach can be improved by passing a WordNet LR
instance to the PR as a runtime param. This is not provided in the demo
application, as it is not possible to provide this in an easily portable way.
Full details of how to create an instance of WordNet within GATE can be found
in the main GATE user guide at the following URL:
