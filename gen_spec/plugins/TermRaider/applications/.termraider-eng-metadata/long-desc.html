<p>TermRaider analyses a set of documents and attempts to determine noun phrase
"term candidates", using various heuristics including TF.IDF scoring and
hyponymy relations.  Results are produced in the form of "termbank" language
resources, which can be explored in various visualisations using the GUI
components provided.</p>
<p>Note that this application makes several passes over the target corpus, so
it is <em>not</em> suitable for use on GATECloud.net.</p>
